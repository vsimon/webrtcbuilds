       The statuses OK, failed and warnings are considered to be conclusive.

       The algorithm looks at the 100 most recent status entries, which should
       give data on roughly the last five revisions if the number of bots stay
       around 20 (The number 100 should be increased if the number of bots
       increases significantly). This should give us enough data to get a
       conclusive build status for all active bots.

       With this limit, the algorithm will adapt automatically if a bot is
       decommissioned - it will eventually disappear. The limit should not be
       too high either since we will perhaps remember offline bots too long,
       which could be confusing. The algorithm also adapts automatically to new
       bots - these show up immediately if they get a build status for a recent
       revision.

           A list of BuildStatusData entities with one entity per bot.
