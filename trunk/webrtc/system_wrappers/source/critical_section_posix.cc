// General note: return values for the various pthread synchronization APIs
// are explicitly ignored here. In Chromium, the same thing is done for release.
// However, in debugging, failure in these APIs are logged. There is currently
// no equivalent to DCHECK_EQ in WebRTC code so this is the best we can do here.
// TODO(henrike): add logging when pthread synchronization APIs are failing.
