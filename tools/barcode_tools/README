This file explains how to set up the Zebra Crossing (Zxing) library in order to
use it in the barcode encoder and decoder tools. Zxing could be found at:
https://code.google.com/p/zxing/

After checkout, the relevant files from Zxing should be in third_party/zxing,
relative to this README.

In order to run barcode_encoder.py and barcode_decoder.py we need to have build
two jar files: zxing/core/core.jar and zxing/javase/javase.jar. In order to
build these we have to have Ant already installed. Building is as simple as
running the build_zxing.py script:
./build_zxing.py,
which should automatically call ant with the respective build files from the
Zxing checkout.

For more information on how to run barcode_encoder.py and barcode_decoder.py
check the documentation in the main functions inside these tools.
